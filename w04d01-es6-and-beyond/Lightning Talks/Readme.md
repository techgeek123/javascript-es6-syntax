# Lightning Talks 

[Lightning Talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) are quick, relevant and succinct session on any topic/idea/concept that you would present to a group of people. 

Ideally a lightning talk should have the following: 
- Overview of the topic 
- Important aspects of the topic. What is so special about it? Why is it special? 
- Examples 
- Closing - Just run through all you presented. Also think of the takeaways you want the audience to have from your talk. This should be the closing.
